# .Net-gram

# Mobile online Work Gram.

## Purpose:
This is my attempt at creating a Razor Pages from ASP.NET Core MVC and Blob storage on Azure.

## Summary
 This is to allow a user to upload work related pictures, update, and delete the pictures.
 Each picture comes with a user name, title, comments, and number of views.

### How to run the program:
```
Use the link below to find a deployed version on an Azure server.
```
[https://netgramworkgram.azurewebsites.net](https://netgramworkgram.azurewebsites.net)

```
If the site is taken down in the future due to server costs, you may clone down the repo and run the program on your local machine using Visual Studio 2017.
