# Work.Net-gram

## Mobile and Desktop online Work Gram.

## Purpose:
This is my attempt at creating a Razor Pages from ASP.NET Core MVC and Blob storage on Azure.

## Summary
 This site is to allow a user to upload work related pictures, update, and delete the pictures.<br>
 Each picture comes with a user name, title, description, and rating(coming soon).<br>
 A fun photo sharing social networking service focusing on your daily jobs and career.

### How to run the program:
Use the link below &dArr; to find a deployed version on an Azure server.<br>
